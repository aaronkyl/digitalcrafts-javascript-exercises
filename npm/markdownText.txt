Markdown Quick Reference
========================

This guide is a very brief overview, with examples, of the syntax that [Markdown] supports.  It is itself written in Markdown and you can copy the samples over to the left-hand pane for experimentation.  It's shown as *text* and not *rendered HTML*.

Simple Text Formatting
======================

First thing is first.  You can use *stars* or _underscores_ for italics.  **Double stars** and __double underscores__ do bold.  ***Three together*** do ___both___.

Paragraphs are pretty easy too.  Just have a blank line between chunks of text.

> This chunk of text is in a block quote.  Its multiple lines will all be
> indended a bit from the rest of the text.
>
> > Multiple levels of block quotes also work.
