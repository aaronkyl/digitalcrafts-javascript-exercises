<h1 id="markdown-quick-reference">Markdown Quick Reference</h1>
<p>This guide is a very brief overview, with examples, of the syntax that <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> supports.  It is itself written in Markdown and you can copy the samples over to the left-hand pane for experimentation.  It&#39;s shown as <em>text</em> and not <em>rendered HTML</em>.</p>
<h1 id="simple-text-formatting">Simple Text Formatting</h1>
<p>First thing is first.  You can use <em>stars</em> or <em>underscores</em> for italics.  <strong>Double stars</strong> and <strong>double underscores</strong> do bold.  <strong><em>Three together</em></strong> do <strong><em>both</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Paragraphs are pretty easy too.  Just have a blank line between chunks of text.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This chunk of text is in a block quote.  Its multiple lines will all be
indended a bit from the rest of the text.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Multiple levels of block quotes also work.</p>
</blockquote>
